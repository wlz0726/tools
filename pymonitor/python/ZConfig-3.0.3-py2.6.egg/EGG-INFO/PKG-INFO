Description: ZConfig: Schema-driven configuration
        ====================================
        
        ZConfig is a configuration library intended for general use.  It
        supports a hierarchical schema-driven configuration model that allows
        a schema to specify data conversion routines written in Python.
        ZConfig's model is very different from the model supported by the
        ConfigParser module found in Python's standard library, and is more
        suitable to configuration-intensive applications.
        
        ZConfig schema are written in an XML-based language and are able to
        "import" schema components provided by Python packages.  Since
        components are able to bind to conversion functions provided by Python
        code in the package (or elsewhere), configuration objects can be
        arbitrarily complex, with values that have been verified against
        arbitrary constraints.  This makes it easy for applications to
        separate configuration support from configuration loading even with
        configuration data being defined and consumed by a wide range of
        separate packages.
        
        ZConfig is licensed under the Zope Public License, version 2.1.  See
        the file LICENSE.txt in the distribution for the full license text.
        
        Reference documentation is available in the doc/ directory.
        
        One common use of ZConfig is to configure the Python logging
        framework. This is extremely simple to do as the following example
        demonstrates:
        
            >>> from ZConfig import configureLoggers
            >>> configureLoggers('''
            ... <logger>
            ...    level INFO
            ...    <logfile>
            ...       PATH STDOUT
            ...       format %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s
            ...    </logfile>
            ... </logger>
            ... ''')
        
        The above configures the root logger to output messages logged at INFO
        or above to the console, as we can see in the following example:
        
            >>> from logging import getLogger
            >>> logger = getLogger()
            >>> logger.info('An info message')
            INFO root An info message
            >>> logger.debug('A debug message')
        
        A more common configuration would see STDOUT replaced with a path to
        the file into which log entries would be written.
        
        For more information, see section 5.2 on the ZConfig documentation and
        the examples in ZConfig/components/logger/tests.
        
        Information on the latest released version of the ZConfig package is
        available at
        
          http://www.zope.org/Members/fdrake/zconfig/
        
        You may either create an RPM and install this, or install directly from
        the source distribution.
        
        There is a mailing list for discussions and questions about ZConfig;
        more information on the list is available at
        
          http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/zconfig/
        
        
        Installing from the source distribution
        ---------------------------------------
        
        For a simple installation::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        
        To install to a user's home-dir::
        
          python setup.py install --home=<dir>
        
        
        To install to another prefix (for example, /usr/local)::
        
          python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
        
        
        If you need to force the python interpreter to (for example) python2::
        
          python2 setup.py install
        
        
        For more information on installing packages, please refer to

        ------------------
        
        - Removed an accidentally left `pdb` statement from the code.
        
        - Fix a bug in Python 3 with the custom string `repr()` function.
        
        
        3.0.0 (2013-02-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Added Python 3.3 support.
        
        - Droped Python 2.4 and 2.5 support.

        ------------------
        
        - Fixed: port values of 0 weren't allowed.  Port 0 is used to request
          an ephemeral port.
        
        
        2.9.2 (2012-02-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust test classes to avoid base classes being considered separate
          test cases by (at least) the "nose" test runner.
        
        
        2.9.1 (2012-02-11)
        ------------------

        2.8.0 (2010-04-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix relative path recognition.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zconfig/+bug/405687
        
        - Added SMTP authentication support for email logger on Python 2.6.
        
        
        2.7.1 (2009-06-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Improved documentation
        
        - Fixed tests failures on windows.
        
        
        2.7.0 (2009-06-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Added a convenience function, ``ZConfig.configureLoggers(text)`` for
          configuring loggers.
        
        - Relaxed the requirement for a logger name in logger sections,
          allowing the logger section to be used for both root and non-root
          loggers.
        
        
        2.6.1 (2008-12-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed support for schema descriptions that override descriptions from a base
          schema.  If multiple base schema provide descriptions but the derived schema
          does not, the first base mentioned that provides a description wins.
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zconfig/+bug/259475
        
        - Fixed compatibility bug with Python 2.5.0.
        
        - No longer trigger deprecation warnings under Python 2.6.
        
        
        2.6.0 (2008-09-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for file rotation by time by specifying when and
          interval, rather than max-size, for log files.
        
        - Removed dependency on setuptools from the setup.py.
        
        
        2.5.1 (2007-12-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Made it possible to run unit tests via 'python setup.py test' (requires
          setuptools on sys.path).
        
        - Added better error messages to test failure assertions.
        
        
        2.5 (2007-08-31)
        ------------------------
        
        *A note on the version number:*
        
        Information discovered in the revision control system suggests that some
        past revision has been called "2.4", though it is not clear that any
        actual release was made with that version number.  We're going to skip
        revision 2.4 entirely to avoid potential issues with anyone using
        something claiming to be ZConfig 2.4, and go straight to version 2.5.
        
        - Add support for importing schema components from ZIP archives (including
          eggs).
        
        - Added a 'formatter' configuration option in the logging handler sections
          to allow specifying a constructor for the formatter.
        
        - Documented the package: URL scheme that can be used in extending schema.
        
        - Added support for reopening all log files opened via configurations using
          the ZConfig.components.logger package.  For Zope, this is usable via the
          ``zc.signalhandler`` package.  ``zc.signalhandler`` is not required for
          ZConfig.
        
        - Added support for rotating log files internally by size.
        
        - Added a minimal implementation of schema-less parsing; this is mostly
          intended for applications that want to read several fragments of ZConfig
          configuration files and assemble a combined configuration.  Used in some
          ``zc.buildout`` recipes.
        
        - Converted to using ``zc.buildout`` and the standard test runner from
          ``zope.testing``.
        
        - Added more tests.
        
        
        2.3.1 (2005-08-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Isolated some of the case-normalization code so it will at least be
          easier to override.  This remains non-trivial.
        
        
        2.3 (2005-05-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Added "inet-binding-address" and "inet-connection-address" to the
          set of standard datatypes.  These are similar to the "inet-address"
          type, but the default hostname is more sensible.  The datatype used
          should reflect how the value will be used.
        
        - Alternate rotating logfile handler for Windows, to avoid platform
          limitations on renaming open files.  Contributed by Sidnei da Silva.
        
        - For <section> and <multisection>, if the name attribute is omitted,
          assume name="*", since this is what is used most often.
        
        
        2.2 (2004-04-21)
        ----------------
        
        - More documentation has been written.
        
        - Added a timedelta datatype function; the input is the same as for
          the time-interval datatype, but the resulting value is a
          datetime.timedelta object.
        
        - Make sure keys specified as attributes of the <default> element are
          converted by the appropriate key type, and are re-checked for
          derived sections.
        
        - Refactored the ZConfig.components.logger schema components so that a
          schema can import just one of the "eventlog" or "logger" sections if
          desired.  This can be helpful to avoid naming conflicts.
        
        - Added a reopen() method to the logger factories.
        
        - Always use an absolute pathname when opening a FileHandler.
        
        - A fix to the logger 'format' key to allow the %(process)d expansion variable
          that the logging package supports.
        
        - A new timedelta built-in datatype was added.  Similar to time-interval
          except that it returns a datetime.timedelta object instead.
        
        
        2.1 (2004-04-12)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed compatibility with Python 2.1 and 2.2.
        
        - Schema components must really be in Python packages; the directory
          search has been modified to perform an import to locate the package
          rather than incorrectly implementing the search algorithm.
        
        - The default objects use for section values now provide a method
          getSectionAttributes(); this returns a list of all the attributes of
          the section object which store configuration-defined data (including
          information derived from the schema).
        
        - Default information can now be included in a schema for <key
          name="+"> and <multikey name="+"> by using <default key="...">.
        
        - More documentation has been added to discuss schema extension.
        
        - Support for a Unicode-free Python has been fixed.
        
        - Derived section types now inherit the datatype of the base type if
          no datatype is identified explicitly.
        
        - Derived section types can now override the keytype instead of always
          inheriting from their base type.
        
        - <import package='...'/> makes use of the current prefix if the
          package name begins witha dot.
        
        - Added two standard datatypes:  dotted-name and dotted-suffix.
        
        - Added two standard schema components: ZConfig.components.basic and
          ZConfig.components.logger.
        
        
        2.0 (2003-10-27)
        ----------------
        
        - Configurations can import additional schema components using a new
          "%import" directive; this can be used to integrate 3rd-party
          components into an application.
        
        - Schemas may be extended using a new "extends" attribute on the
          <schema> element.
        
        - Better error messages when elements in a schema definition are
          improperly nested.
        
        - The "zconfig" script can now simply verify that a schema definition
          is valid, if that's all that's needed.
        
        
        1.0 (2003-03-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
