Description: *****************************************************
        ``zdaemon`` process controller for Unix-based systems
        *****************************************************
        
        ``zdaemon`` is a Unix (Unix, Linux, Mac OS X) Python program that wraps
        commands to make them behave as proper daemons.

        ===============
         Using zdaemon
        ===============
        
        zdaemon provides a script, zdaemon, that can be used to run other
        programs as POSIX (Unix) daemons. (Of course, it is only usable on
        POSIX-complient systems.)
        
        Using zdaemon requires specifying a number of options, which can be
        given in a configuration file, or as command-line options.  It also
        accepts commands teling it what do do.  The commands are:
        
        start
            Start a process as a daemon
        
        stop
            Stop a running daemon process
        
        restart
            Stop and then restart a program
        
        status
            Find out if the program is running
        
        foreground or fg
            Run a program
        
        kill signal
            Send a signal to the daemon process
        
        reopen_transcript
            Reopen the transcript log.  See the discussion of the transcript
            log below.
        
        help command
            Get help on a command
        
        
        Commands can be given on a command line, or can be given using an
        interactive interpreter.
        
        Let's start with a simple example.  We'll use command-line options to
        run the echo command:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -p 'echo hello world' fg
            echo hello world
            hello world
        
        
        Here we used the -p option to specify a program to run.  We can
        specify a program name and command-line options in the program
        command. Note, however, that the command-line parsing is pretty
        primitive.  Quotes and spaces aren't handled correctly.  Let's look at
        a slightly more complex example.  We'll run the sleep command as a
        daemon :)
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -p 'sleep 100' start
            . .
            daemon process started, pid=819
        
        This ran the sleep deamon.  We can check whether it ran with the
        status command:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -p 'sleep 100' status
            program running; pid=819
        
        We can stop it with the stop command:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -p 'sleep 100' stop
            . .
            daemon process stopped
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -p 'sleep 100' status
            daemon manager not running
            Failed: 3
        
        Normally, we control zdaemon using a configuration file.  Let's create
        a typical configuration file::
        
            <runner>
              program sleep 100
            </runner>
        
        .. -> text
        
            >>> with open('conf', 'w') as file:
            ...     _ = file.write(text)
        
        Now, we can run with the -C option to read the configuration file:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf start
            . .
            daemon process started, pid=1136
        
        If we list the directory:
        
            sh> ls
            conf
            zdaemon
            zdsock
        
        We'll see that a file, zdsock, was created.  This is a unix-domain
        socket used internally by ZDaemon.  We'll normally want to control
        where this goes.
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf stop
            . .
            daemon process stopped
        
        Here's an updated configuration::
        
            <runner>
              program sleep 100
              socket-name /tmp/demo.zdsock
            </runner>
        
        .. -> text
        
            >>> with open('conf', 'w') as file:
            ...     _ = file.write(text.replace('/tmp', tmpdir))
        
        Now, when we run zdaemon:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf start
            . .
            daemon process started, pid=1139
        
            sh> ls
            conf
            zdaemon
        
        .. test
        
            >>> import os
            >>> os.path.exists("/tmp/demo.zdsock".replace('/tmp', tmpdir))
            True
        
        The socket file is created in the given directory.
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf stop
            . .
            daemon process stopped
        
        In the example, we included a command-line argument in the program
        option. We can also provide options on the command line::
        
            <runner>
              program sleep
              socket-name /tmp/demo.zdsock
            </runner>
        
        .. -> text
        
            >>> with open('conf', 'w') as file:
            ...     _ = file.write(text.replace('/tmp', tmpdir))
        
        Then we can pass the program argument on the command line:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf start 100
            . .
            daemon process started, pid=1149
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf status
            program running; pid=1149
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf stop
            . .
            daemon process stopped
        
        Environment Variables
        =====================
        
        Sometimes, it is necessary to set environment variables before running
        a program.  Perhaps the most common case for this is setting
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that dynamically loaded libraries can be found.
        
        ::
        
            <runner>
              program env
              socket-name /tmp/demo.zdsock
            </runner>
            <environment>
              LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/foo/lib
              HOME /home/foo
            </environment>
        
        .. -> text
        
            >>> with open('conf', 'w') as file:
            ...     _ = file.write(text.replace('/tmp', tmpdir))
        
        Now, when we run the command, we'll see out environment settings reflected:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf fg
            env
            USER=jim
            HOME=/home/foo
            LOGNAME=jim
            USERNAME=jim
            TERM=dumb
            PATH=/home/jim/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin
            EMACS=t
            LANG=en_US.UTF-8
            SHELL=/bin/bash
            EDITOR=emacs
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/foo/lib
        
        Transcript log
        ==============
        
        When zdaemon run a program in daemon mode, it disconnects the
        program's standard input, standard output, and standard error from the
        controlling terminal.  It can optionally redirect the output to
        standard error and standard output to a file.  This is done with the
        transcript option.  This is, of course, useful for logging output from
        long-running applications.
        
        Let's look at an example. We'll have a long-running process that
        simple tails a data file:
        
            >>> f = open('data', 'w', 1)
            >>> import os
            >>> _ = f.write('rec 1\n'); f.flush(); os.fsync(f.fileno())
        
        Now, here's out zdaemon configuration::
        
            <runner>
              program tail -f data
              transcript log
            </runner>
        
        .. -> text
        
            >>> with open('conf', 'w') as file:
            ...     _ = file.write(text)
        
        Now we'll start:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf start
            . .
            daemon process started, pid=7963
        
        .. Wait a little bit to make sure tail has a chance to work
        
            >>> import time
            >>> time.sleep(0.1)
        
        After waiting a bit, if we look at the log file, it contains the tail output:
        
            >>> with open('log') as file:
            ...     file.read()
            'rec 1\n'
        
        We can rotate the transcript log by renaming it and telling zdaemon to
        reopen it:
        
            >>> import os
            >>> os.rename('log', 'log.1')
        
        If we generate more output:
        
            >>> _ = f.write('rec 2\n'); f.flush(); os.fsync(f.fileno())
        
        .. Wait a little bit to make sure tail has a chance to work
        
            >>> time.sleep(1)
        
        The output will appear in the old file, because zdaemon still has it
        open:
        
            >>> with open('log.1') as file:
            ...     file.read()
            'rec 1\nrec 2\n'
        
        Now, if we tell zdaemon to reopen the file:
        
            sh> ./zdaemon -Cconf reopen_transcript
        
        and generate some output:
        
            >>> _ = f.write('rec 3\n'); f.flush(); os.fsync(f.fileno())
        
        .. Wait a little bit to make sure tail has a chance to work
        
            >>> time.sleep(1)
        
        the output will show up in the new file, not the old:
        
            >>> with open('log') as file:
            ...     file.read()
            'rec 3\n'
        
            >>> with open('log.1') as file:
            ...     file.read()
            'rec 1\nrec 2\n'
        
        Close files:
        
            >>> f.close()
        
        Start test program and timeout
        ==============================
        
        Normally, zdaemon considers a process to have started when the process
        itself has been created.  A process may take a while before it is
        truly up and running.  For example, a database server or a web server
        may take time before they're ready to accept requests.
        
        You can optionally supply a test program, via the ``start-test-program``
        configuration option, that is called repeatedly until it returns a 0
        exit status or until a time limit, ``start-timeout``, has been reached.
        
        Reference Documentation
        =======================
        
        The following options are available for use in the runner section of
        configuration files and as command-line options.
        
        program
                Command-line option: -p or --program
        
                This option gives the command used to start the subprocess
                managed by zdaemon.  This is currently a simple list of
                whitespace-delimited words. The first word is the program
                file, subsequent words are its command line arguments.  If the
                program file contains no slashes, it is searched using $PATH.
                (Note that there is no way to to include whitespace in the program
                file or an argument, and under certain circumstances other
                shell metacharacters are also a problem.)
        
        socket-name
                Command-line option: -s or --socket-name.
        
                The pathname of the Unix domain socket used for communication
                between the zdaemon command-line tool and a deamon-management
                process.  The default is relative to the current directory in
                which zdaemon is started.  You want to specify
                an absolute pathname here.
        
                This defaults to "zdsock", which is created in the directory
                in which zdrun is started.
        
        daemon
                Command-line option: -d or --daemon.
        
                If this option is true, zdaemon runs in the background as a
                true daemon.  It forks a child process which becomes the
                subprocess manager, while the parent exits (making the shell
                that started it believe it is done).  The child process also
                does the following:
        
                - if the directory option is set, change into that directory
        
                - redirect stdin, stdout and stderr to /dev/null
        
                - call setsid() so it becomes a session leader
        
                - call umask() with specified value
        
                The default for this option is on by default.  The
                command-line option therefore has no effect.  To disable
                daemon mode, you must use a configuration file::
        
                  <runner>
                    program sleep 1
                    daemon off
                  </runner>
        
        directory
                Command-line option: -z or --directory.
        
                If the daemon option is true (default), this option can
                specify a directory into which zdrun.py changes as part of the
                "daemonizing".  If the daemon option is false, this option is
                ignored.
        
        backoff-limit
                Command-line option: -b or --backoff-limit.
        
                When the subprocess crashes, zdaemon inserts a one-second
                delay before it restarts it.  When the subprocess crashes
                again right away, the delay is incremented by one second, and
                so on.  What happens when the delay has reached the value of
                backoff-limit (in seconds), depends on the value of the
                forever option.  If forever is false, zdaemon gives up at
                this point, and exits.  An always-crashing subprocess will
                have been restarted exactly backoff-limit times in this case.
                If forever is true, zdaemon continues to attempt to restart
                the process, keeping the delay at backoff-limit seconds.
        
                If the subprocess stays up for more than backoff-limit
                seconds, the delay is reset to 1 second.
        
                This defaults to 10.
        
        forever
                Command-line option: -f or --forever.
        
                If this option is true, zdaemon will keep restarting a
                crashing subprocess forever.  If it is false, it will give up
                after backoff-limit crashes in a row.  See the description of
                backoff-limit for details.
        
                This is disabled by default.
        
        exit-codes
                Command-line option: -x or --exit-codes.
        
                This defaults to 0,2.
        
                If the subprocess exits with an exit status that is equal to
                one of the integers in this list, zdaemon will not restart
                it.  The default list requires some explanation.  Exit status
                0 is considered a willful successful exit; the ZEO and Zope
                server processes use this exit status when they want to stop
                without being restarted.  (Including in response to a
                SIGTERM.)  Exit status 2 is typically issued for command line
                syntax errors; in this case, restarting the program will not
                help!
        
                NOTE: this mechanism overrides the backoff-limit and forever
                options; i.e. even if forever is true, a subprocess exit
                status code in this list makes zdaemon give up.  To disable
                this, change the value to an empty list.
        
        start-test-program
                A command that tests whether the program is up and running.
                The command should exit with a zero exit statis if the program
                is running and with a non-zero status otherwise.
        
        start-timeout
                Command-line option: -T or --start-timeout.
        
                If the program takes more than ``start-timeout`` seconds to
                start, then an error is printed and the control script will
                exit with a non-zero exit status.
        
        stop-timeout
                This defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
        
                When a stop command is issued, a SIGTERM signal is sent to the
                process.  zdaemon waits for stop-timeout seconds for the
                process to gracefully exit. If the process doesn't exit in
                that time, a SIGKILL signal is sent.
        
        user
                Command-line option: -u or --user.
        
                When zdaemon is started by root, this option specifies the
                user as who the the zdaemon process (and hence the daemon
                subprocess) will run.  This can be a user name or a numeric
                user id.  Both the user and the group are set from the
                corresponding password entry, using setuid() and setgid().
                This is done before zdaemon does anything else besides
                parsing its command line arguments.
        
                NOTE: when zdaemon is not started by root, specifying this
                option is an error.  (XXX This may be a mistake.)
        
                XXX The zdaemon event log file may be opened *before*
                setuid() is called.  Is this good or bad?
        
        umask
                Command-line option: -m or --umask.
        
                When daemon mode is used, this option specifies the octal umask
                of the subprocess.
        
        default-to-interactive
                If this option is true, zdaemon enters interactive mode
                when it is invoked without a positional command argument.  If
                it is false, you must use the -i or --interactive command line
                option to zdaemon to enter interactive mode.
        
                This is enabled by default.
        
        logfile
                This option specifies a log file that is the default target of
                the "logtail" zdaemon command.
        
                NOTE: This is NOT the log file to which zdaemon writes its
                logging messages!  That log file is specified by the
                <eventlog> section described below.
        
        transcript
                The name of a file in which a transcript of all output from
                the command being run will be written to when daemonized.
        
                If not specified, output from the command will be discarded.
        
                This only takes effect when the "daemon" option is enabled.
        
        prompt
                 The prompt shown by the controller program.  The default must
                 be provided by the application.
        
        (Note that a few other options are available to support old
        configuration files, but aren't needed any more and can generally be
        ignored.)
        
        In addition to the runner section, you can use an eventlog section
        that specified one or more logfile subsections::
        
            <eventlog>
              <logfile>
                path /var/log/foo/foo.log
              </logfile>
        
              <logfile>
                path STDOUT
              </logfile>
            </eventlog>
        
        In this example, log output is sent to a file and to standard out.
        Log output from zdaemon usually isn't very interesting but can be
        handy for debugging.
        
        ==========
        Change log
        ==========
        
        4.0.0 (2013-05-10)
        ==================
        
        - Note / test support for Python 3.2.
        
        4.0.0a1 (2013-02-15)
        ====================
        
        - Added tox support and MANIFEST.in for proper releasing.
        
        - Added Python 3.3 support.
        
        - Drop Python 2.4 and 2.5 support.
        
        3.0.5 (2012-11-27)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed: the status command didn't return a non-zero exit status when
          the program wasn't running. This made it impossible for other
          software (e.g. Puppet) to tell if a process was running.
        
        3.0.4 (2012-07-30)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed: The start command exited with a zero exit status even when
          the program being started failed to start (or exited imediately).
        
        3.0.3 (2012-07-10)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed: programs started with zdaemon couldn't, themselves, invoke
          zdaemon.
        
        3.0.2 (2012-07-10)
        ==================
        
        Fail :(
        
        3.0.1 (2012-06-08)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed:
        
          The change in 2.0.6 to set a user's supplemental groups broke common
          configurations in which the effective user was set via ``su`` or
          ``sudo -u`` prior to invoking zdaemon.
        
          Now, zdaemon doesn't set groups or the effective user if the
          effective user is already set to the configured user.
        
        3.0.0 (2012-06-08)
        ==================
        
        - Added an option, ``start-test-program`` to supply a test command to
          test whether the program managed by zdaemon is up and operational,
          rather than just running.  When starting a program, the start
          command doesn't return until the test passes. You could, for
          example, use this to wait until a web server is actually accepting
          connections.
        
        - Added a ``start-timeout`` option to error if a program takes too long to
          start. This is especially useful in combination with the
          ``start-test-program`` option.
        
        - Added an option, stop-timeout, to control how long to wait
          for a graceful shutdown.
        
          Previously, this was controlled by backoff-limit, which didn't make
          much sense.
        
        - Several undocumented, untested, and presumably unused features were removed.
        
        2.0.6 (2012-06-07)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed: When the ``user`` option was used to run as a particular
          user, supplemental groups weren't set to the user's supplemental
          groups.
        
        2.0.5 (2012-06-07)
        ==================
        
        (Accidental release. Please ignore.)
        
        2.0.4 (2009-04-20)
        ==================
        
        - Version 2.0.3 broke support for relative paths to the socket (``-s``
          option and ``socket-name`` parameter), now relative paths work again
          as in version 2.0.2.
        
        - Fixed change log format, made table of contents nicer.
        
        - Fixed author's email address.
        
        - Removed zpkg stuff.
        
        
        2.0.3 (2009-04-11)
        ==================
        
        - Added support to bootstrap on Jython.
        
        - If the run directory does not exist it will be created. This allow to use
          `/var/run/mydaemon` as run directory when /var/run is a tmpfs (LP #318118).
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - No longer uses a hard-coded file name (/tmp/demo.zdsock) in unit tests.
          This lets you run the tests on Python 2.4 and 2.5 simultaneously without
          spurious errors.
        
        - make -h work again for both runner and control scripts.
          Help is now taken from the __doc__ of the options class users by
          the zdaemon script being run.
        
        2.0.2 (2008-04-05)
        ==================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - Fixed backwards incompatible change in handling of environment option.
        
        2.0.1 (2007-10-31)
        ==================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - Fixed test renormalizer that did not work in certain cases where the
          environment was complex.
        
        2.0.0 (2007-07-19)
        ==================
        
        - Final release for 2.0.0.
        
        2.0a6 (2007-01-11)
        ==================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - When the user option was used, it only affected running the daemon.
        
        2.0a3, 2.0a4, 2.0a5 (2007-01-10)
        ================================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - The new (2.0) mechanism used by zdaemon to start the daemon manager
          broke some applications that extended zdaemon.
        
        - Added extra checks to deal with programs that extend zdaemon
          and copy the schema and thus don't see updates to the ZConfig schema.
        
        2.0a2 (2007-01-10)
        ==================
        
        New Features
        ------------
        
        - Added support for setting environment variables in the configuration
          file.  This is useful when zdaemon is used to run programs that need
          environment variables set (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
        
        - Added a command to rotate the transcript log.
        
        2.0a1 (2006-12-21)
        ==================
        
        Bugs Fixed
        ----------
        
        - In non-daemon mode, start hung, producing annoying dots
          when the program exited.
        
        - The start command hung producing annoying dots if the daemon failed
          to start.
        
        - foreground and start had different semantics because one used
          os.system and another used os.spawn
        
        New Features
        ------------
        
        - Documentation
        
        - Command-line arguments can now be supplied to the start and
          foreground (fg) commands
        
        - zdctl now invokes itself to run zdrun.  This means that it's
          no-longer necessary to generate a separate zdrun script.  This
          especially when the magic techniques to find and run zdrun using
          directory sniffing fail to set the path correctly.
        
        - The daemon mode is now enabled by default.  To get non-daemon mode,
          you have to use a configuration file and set daemon to off
          there. The old -d option is kept for backward compatibility, but is
          a no-op.
        
        1.4a1 (2005-11-21)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed a bug in the distribution setup file.
        
        1.4a1 (2005-11-05)
        ==================
        
        - First semi-formal release.
        
        After some unknown release(???)
        ===============================
        
        - Made 'zdaemon.zdoptions' not fail for --help when __main__.__doc__
          is None.
        
        After 1.1
        =========
        
        - Updated test 'testRunIgnoresParentSignals':
        
         o Use 'mkdtemp' to create a temporary directory to hold the test socket
           rather than creating the test socket in the test directory.
           Hopefully this will be more robust.  Sometimes the test directory
           has a path so long that the test socket can't be created.
        
         o Changed management of 'donothing.sh'.  This script is now created by
           the test in the temporarily directory with the necessary
           permissions. This is to avoids possible mangling of permissions
           leading to spurious test failures.  It also avoids management of a
           file in the source tree, which is a bonus.
        
        - Rearranged source tree to conform to more usual zpkg-based layout:
        
          o Python package lives under 'src'.
        
          o Dependencies added to 'src' as 'svn:externals'.
        
          o Unit tests can now be run from a checkout.
        
        - Made umask-based test failures due to running as root emit a more
          forceful warning.
        
        1.1 (2005-06-09)
        ================
        
        - SVN tag:  svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zdaemon/tags/zdaemon-1.1
        
        - Tagged to make better 'svn:externals' linkage possible.
        
        To-Dos
        ======
        
        More docs:
        
        - Document/demonstrate some important features, such as:
        
          - working directory
        
        Bugs:
