Description: ``persistent``:  automatic persistence for Python objects
        =========================================================
        
        This package contains a generic persistence implementation for Python. It
        forms the core protocol for making objects interact "transparently" with
        a database such as the ZODB.
        
        Please see the Sphinx documentation (``docs/index.rst``) for further
        information.
        
        
        ``persistent`` Changelog
        ========================
        
        
        4.0.6 (2013-01-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated Trove classifiers.
        
        
        4.0.5 (2012-12-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the C-extensions under Py3k (previously they compiled but were
          not importable).
        
        
        4.0.4 (2012-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for Python 3.3.
        
        - C extenstions now build under Python 3.2, passing the same tests as
          the pure-Python reference implementation.
        
        4.0.3 (2012-11-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed: In the C implimentation, an integer was compared with a
          pointer, with undefined results and a compiler warning.
        
        - Fixed: the Python implementation of the ``_p_estimated_size`` propety
          didn't support deletion.
        
        - Simplified implementation of the ``_p_estimated_size`` property to
          only accept integers.  A TypeError is raised if an incorrect type is
          provided.
        
        
        4.0.2 (2012-08-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Correct initialization functions in renamed ``_timestamp`` extension.
        
        
        4.0.1 (2012-08-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Worked around test failure due to overflow to long on 32-bit systems.
        
        - Renamed ``TimeStamp`` extension module to avoid clash with pure-Python
          ``timestamp`` module on case-insensitive filesystems.
        
          N.B:  the canonical way to import the ``TimeStamp`` class is now::
        
            from persistent.timestamp import TimeStamp
        
          which will yield the class from the extension module (if available),
          falling back to the pure-Python reference implementation.
        
        
        4.0.0 (2012-08-11)
        ------------------
        
        Platform Changes
        ################
        
        - Added explicit support for Python 3.2 and PyPy.
        
          - Note that the C implementations of Persistent, PickleCache, and Timestamp
            are not built (yet) on these platforms.
        
        - Dropped support for Python < 2.6.
        
        Testing Changes
        ###############
        
        - 100% unit test coverage.
        
        - Removed all ``ZODB``-dependent tests:
        
          - Rewrote some to avoid the dependency
          
          - Cloned the remainder into new ``ZODB.tests`` modules.
        
        - Refactored some doctests refactored as unittests.
        
        - Completed pure-Python reference implementations of 'Persistent',
          'PickleCache', and 'TimeStamp'.
        
        - All covered platforms tested under ``tox``.
        
        - Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.
        
        - Added ``setup.py dev`` alias (installs ``nose`` and ``coverage``).
        
        - Dropped dependency on ``zope.testing`` / ``zope.testrunner``:  tests now
          run with ``setup.py test``.
        
        Documentation Changes
        #####################
        
        - Refactored many Doctests as Sphinx documentation (snippets are exercised
          via 'tox').
        
        - Added ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and
          ``repoze.sphinx.autointerface``).
